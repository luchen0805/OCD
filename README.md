# OCD

# **Brief description of the dataset**

The dataset is about the mixed information for OCD patients. It collects information on 1500 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), including variables like age, gender, race, marital status, education level, family history, medications, etc.. At the same time, the dataset also includes the classification of OCD symptoms. All these information can be used to analyze how OCD manifests itself in different patient groups.

# **Brief overview of the project**

I plan to use this dataset to answer the following proposed research questions.

## ***Potential research questions proposed***

1. Is there a significant difference in the prevalence of OCD among individuals with varying levels of education?
2. Does the family history of OCD contribute to the development of the OCD disorder?
3. Are patients previously diagnosed with other disorders more likely to develop OCD?
