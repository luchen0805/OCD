  abstract = {The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is widely acknowledged as the gold standard measure of obsessive{\textendash}compulsive disorder (OCD) symptom severity. Despite its popularity, a number of questions remain regarding the Y-BOCS' psychometric properties including: (a) whether obsessional and compulsive symptoms contribute independently to global OCD severity and (b) whether the Y-BOCS subscales are valid with respect to other measures of OCD. We examined these issues in a sample of 100 patients with a diagnosis of OCD. While our confirmatory factor analyses failed to reproduce any previously reported models of the Y-BOCS factor structure, exploratory factor analysis indicated a two-factor solution that assessed symptom severity (i.e., time, distress, and interference from obsessions and compulsions) as separate from resistance and control of obsessions and compulsions. In contrast to the Resistance/Control Subscale, the Severity Subscale demonstrated good psychometric properties and construct validity. Based on our findings we recommend revisions to scoring the Y-BOCS.},

  abstract = {Background Anxiety sensitivity, the tendency to fear the symptoms of anxiety, is a key risk factor for the development anxiety disorders. Although obsessive{\textendash}compulsive disorder was previously classified as an anxiety disorder, the prospective relationship between anxiety sensitivity and obsessive{\textendash}compulsive symptoms (OCS) has been largely overlooked. Furthermore, a lack of genetically informative studies means the aetiology of the link between anxiety sensitivity and OCS remains unclear. Methods Adolescent twins and siblings (N~=~1,579) from the G1219 study completed self-report questionnaires two years apart assessing anxiety sensitivity, OCS, anxiety and depression. Linear regression models tested prospective associations between anxiety sensitivity and OCS, with and without adjustment for anxiety and depressive symptoms. A phenotypic cross-lagged model assessed bidirectional influences between anxiety sensitivity and OCS over time, and a genetic version of this model examined the aetiology of these associations. Results Anxiety sensitivity was prospectively associated with changes in OCS, even after controlling for comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. The longitudinal relationship between anxiety sensitivity and OCS was bidirectional, and these associations were predominantly accounted for by nonshared environmental influences. Conclusions Our findings are consistent with the notion that anxiety sensitivity is a risk factor for OCS during adolescence, but also suggest that experiencing OCS confers risk for heightened anxiety sensitivity. The reciprocal links between OCS and anxiety sensitivity over time are likely to be largely mediated by nonshared environmental experiences, as opposed to common genes. Our findings raise the possibility that interventions aimed at ameliorating anxiety sensitivity could reduce risk for OCS, and vice versa.},

  abstract = {The Yale{\textendash}Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) is a widely used instrument to assess obsessive{\textendash}compulsive symptomatology. The present study provides evidence that the Y-BOCS is best represented by a three-dimensional model comprising severity of obsessions (factor 1), severity of compulsions (factor 2) and resistance to symptoms (factor 3). On the basis of exploratory factor analysis, this structure was found for both baseline (n=109) and discharge ratings (n=68) following a multimodal cognitive{\textendash}behavioral intervention. The factor solution remained essentially unchanged when two optional items (items 1b and 6b) were dropped from analysis. The three-factor structure was replicated with confirmatory factor analysis and showed better fit than previously proposed single- and two-factor models. For future research, we propose a new Y-BOCS scoring algorithm that takes this factor structure into account. A further result was that resistance significantly declined in response to cognitive{\textendash}behavioral intervention, whereas drug treatment alone did not seem to moderate this variable according to previous research conducted by Kim et al. [Psychiatry Research 51 (1994) 203{\textendash}211].},

Despite children spending most of their waking hours at school, evidence about the effects of OCD on school functioning is limited. Parents of OCD-affected youth completed a school functioning survey developed by the authors. Survey content captured parents' perspectives about the impacts of OCD on their child's school functioning, their experiences with, and rationale behind, disclosing versus not disclosing the OCD diagnosis and the involvement and supports provided at the school. Descriptive statistics, {$\chi$}2 tests, and independent samples t-tests were computed to analyze the survey data. Out of 233 invited participants, 37\% (n\,=\,87) of parents of OCD-affected youth (M age\,=\,14.4 years, 60\% female, 71\% Caucasian) completed the survey. Most respondents endorsed a negative impact of OCD on their child's school functioning (73\%; n\,=\,49), especially related to avoidance of activities, places, objects, and people at school (93\%; n\,=\,62). Most participants disclosed their child's OCD diagnosis to the school (85\%; n\,=\,74) and had an overall positive experience (93\%; n\,=\,69). There were no statistically significant clinical and demographic characteristics differences between those who disclosed versus those who did not disclose the diagnosis. Individuals who participated in group family-based CBT and whose child had cleaning, symmetry or forbidden thoughts symptoms were more likely to complete the survey than invited non-survey respondents. Findings enhance the current understanding of how OCD affects the academic life of students and provide preliminary support for positive outcomes associated with disclosure to school professionals.},

  abstract = {Obsessive{\textendash}compulsive disorder (OCD) encompasses a broad range of symptoms representing multiple domains. This complex phenotype can be summarized using a few consistent and temporally stable symptom dimensions. The objective of this study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Dimensional Yale{\textendash}Brown Obsessive{\textendash}Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS). This scale measures the presence and severity of obsessive{\textendash}compulsive (OC) symptoms within six distinct dimensions that combine thematically related obsessions and compulsions. The DY-BOCS includes portions to be used as a self-report instrument and portions to be used by expert raters, including global ratings of OC symptom severity and overall impairment. We assessed 137 patients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV diagnosis of OCD, aged 6{\textendash}69 years, from sites in the USA, Canada and Brazil. Estimates of the reliability and validity of both the expert and self-report versions of the DY-BOCS were calculated and stratified according to age (pediatric vs. adult subjects). The internal consistency of each of the six symptom dimensions and the global severity score were excellent. The inter-rater agreement was also excellent for all component scores. Self-report and expert ratings were highly intercorrelated. The global DY-BOCS score was highly correlated with the total Yale{\textendash}Brown Obsessive{\textendash}Compulsive Scale score (Pearson r=0.82, P{$<$}0.0001). Severity scores for individual symptom dimensions were largely independent of one another, only modestly correlated with the global ratings, and were also differentially related to ratings of depression, anxiety and tic severity. No major differences were observed when the results were stratified by age. These results indicate that the DY-BOCS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing multiple aspects of OCD symptom severity in natural history, neuroimaging, treatment response and genetic studies when administered by expert clinicians or their highly trained staff.},
