```{r plot for correlation of family history of OCD and education levels}
# To see how the presence or absence of a family history of OCD correlates with the frequency of OCD diagnoses across education levels, I plan to create a bar graph. The x-axis stands for the education levels. The y-axis represents the frequency or count of individuals diagnosed with OCD at each education level. The filling represents whether individuals have a family history of OCD.

# according to the plot, within the group of individuals without a family history of OCD, the graduate degree column has the lowest height, and the some college column has the highest height, following by high school and college degree column. So, it can be concluded that the lower the education level, the more individuals have diagnosed with OCD. But statistical analysis is needed: binomial test using yes/no (yes=1, no=0), or chi-square test.

# perform the binomial test
binom.test <- binom.test(sum(data$Family.History.of.OCD == "Yes"), nrow(data), alternative = "two.sided")
print(binom.test)

# analyze the binomial test result
# Based on the p-value (0.6237), which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is not enough evidence to conclude that the true probability of having a family history of OCD is different from 0.5. Additionally, the sample estimate of the probability of success (0.5066667) is very close to 0.5, further supporting the lack of evidence for a significant deviation from the null hypothesis. So, there is no significant association between family history of OCD and education level.

# perform the chi-square test
# summarize the counts of "Yes" and "No" responses for family history of OCD across different education levels
response_table <- table(data$Family.History.of.OCD, data$Education.Level)
chi_square_test <- chisq.test(response_table)
print(chi_square_test)

# analyze the chi-square test result
# With a p-value of 0.2385, which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant association between family history of OCD and education level. So, there is no significant association between family history of OCD and education level.

# analyze the summary_stats
# Mean Score by Education Level: From the table, the mean Y.BOCS.Score varies slightly across different education levels within each Score_Type (Obsessions and Compulsions). The mean score for Compulsions ranges from 18.5 to 20.2, while for Obsessions, it ranges from 19.5 to 20.6. This suggests that there might be some differences in symptom severity based on education level, although the differences are relatively small.
# Median Score by Education Level: Similarly, the median score provides an indication of the central tendency of the data. The median Y.BOCS.Score varies slightly across different education levels within each Score_Type (Obsessions and Compulsions).
# Standard Deviation: The standard deviation (sd_score) measures the variability/spread of the Y.BOCS.Score within each group. Higher standard deviations indicate greater variability in scores. From the table, it is observed that the standard deviations are relatively consistent across different education levels within each Score_Type, ranging from approximately 11.6 to 11.9. This suggests that the spread of Y.BOCS.Score does not vary significantly across education levels.
# Minimum and Maximum Scores: The minimum and maximum scores provide insights into the range of Y.BOCS.Score within each group. In this case, it is observed that the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 40 for all education levels within each Score_Type. This indicates that the full range of scores is observed across all education levels, and there are no outliers beyond this range.
# Overall, while there are slight variations in mean and median scores across education levels within each Score_Type, the differences are relatively small. Additionally, the variability in Y.BOCS.Score does not appear to vary significantly across education levels. Further statistical analysis, such as ANOVA, could be conducted to formally assess whether there are statistically significant differences in Y.BOCS.Score across education levels within each Score_Type.

# Perform ANOVA for Obsessions
obsessions_anova <- aov(Score_Value ~ Education.Level, data = data_long[data_long$Score_Type == "Y.BOCS.Score..Obsessions.", ])

# Perform ANOVA for Compulsions
compulsions_anova <- aov(Score_Value ~ Education.Level, data = data_long[data_long$Score_Type == "Y.BOCS.Score..Compulsions.", ])

# Summarize ANOVA results
obsessions_anova_summary <- summary(obsessions_anova)
compulsions_anova_summary <- summary(compulsions_anova)

library(agricolae)
TukeyHSD(obsessions_anova)

# Analyze ANOVA results
# Obsession
# The p-value associated with the F value is 0.348, which is above the conventional significance level of 0.05. This indicates that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there are no statistically significant differences in Y.BOCS.Score across education levels within Obsessions.
# Compulsion
# The p-value associated with the F value is 0.169, which is above the conventional significance level of 0.05. This indicates that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there are no statistically significant differences in Y.BOCS.Score across education levels within Compulsions.
# In both cases, since the p-values are greater than 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there are no statistically significant differences in Y.BOCS.Score across education levels within Obsessions or Compulsions.

# **Introduction**



<!-- Ordered list -->
I will analyze these three research questions below.  
1. Is there a significant difference in the prevalence of OCD among individuals with varying levels of education?  
2. Does the family history of OCD contribute to the development of the OCD disorder?  
3. Are patients previously diagnosed with other disorders more likely to develop OCD?

<!-- Unordered list -->
I will analyze from three aspects.  
* Association of education level with prevalence of OCD.  
* Association of family history of OCD with prevalence of OCD.  
* Association of previously diagnosed disorders with prevalence of OCD.
