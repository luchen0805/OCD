# this plot can be analyzed from two aspects: with vs. without family history of OCD and frequency of OCD; correlation between family history of OCD and education level.

# based on the plot, within the group of individuals with a family history of OCD, the "high school" column has the lowest number of 174, followed by "college degree" with 187 patients, "some college" with 193 patients, and "graduate degree" with 206 patients. As the number of patients increase, there is an increase in education level except the "some college" number. So, it might be concluded that the higher the education level, the more individuals have diagnosed with OCD.

# within the group of individuals without a family history of OCD, the "graduate degree" has the lowest number of 170, followed by "college degree" with 179 patients, "high school" with 190 patients, and "some college" with 201 patients. As the number of patients increase, there is a decrease in education level except the "some college" number. So, it might be concluded that the lower the education level, the more individuals have diagnosed with OCD.

# overall, hypothesis can be made: there is significant association between family history of OCD and education level.

# summarize the account for with and without family history of OCD
with_without_history_summary <- data %>%
  group_by(Family.History.of.OCD) %>%
  summarize(Frequency = n(), .groups = "drop")

# then, compare between with a family history of OCD and without a family history of OCD, with a family history of OCD tends to have higher frequencies than without a family history of OCD in general, with 760 for with a family history of OCD and 740 for without a family history of OCD. So, it might be concluded that/hypothesis can be that there is a significant association between family history of OCD and frequency of OCD. More specifically, OCD is more likely to occur in patients with a family history of OCD.

# to make more accurate conclusions, statistical analysis is needed to test these hypotheses: binomial test using yes/no (yes=1, no=0) and chi-square test.

print(binom.test)

# Based on the p-value (0.6237), which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is not enough evidence to conclude that the true probability of having a family history of OCD is different from 0.5. Additionally, the sample estimate of the probability of success (0.5066667) is very close to 0.5, further supporting the lack of evidence for a significant deviation from the null hypothesis. So, there is no significant association between family history of OCD and frequency of OCD.

# chi-square test
# correlation between two categorical variables: family history of OCD and education level
# summarize the counts of "Yes" and "No" responses for family history of OCD across different education levels
response_table <- table(data$Family.History.of.OCD, data$Education.Level)

# With a p-value of 0.2385, which is greater than the typical significance level of 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant association between family history of OCD and education level. So, there is no significant association between family history of OCD and education level.

# Mean Score by Education Level: From the table, the mean Y.BOCS.Score varies slightly across different education levels within each Score_Type (Obsessions and Compulsions). The mean score for Compulsions ranges from 18.5 to 20.2, while for Obsessions, it ranges from 19.5 to 20.6. This suggests that there might be some differences in symptom severity based on education level, although the differences are relatively small.

# Median Score by Education Level: Similarly, the median score provides an indication of the central tendency of the data. The median Y.BOCS.Score varies slightly across different education levels within each Score_Type (Obsessions and Compulsions).

# Standard Deviation: The standard deviation (sd_score) measures the variability/spread of the Y.BOCS.Score within each group. Higher standard deviations indicate greater variability in scores. From the table, it is observed that the standard deviations are relatively consistent across different education levels within each Score_Type, ranging from approximately 11.6 to 11.9. This suggests that the spread of Y.BOCS.Score does not vary significantly across education levels.

# Minimum and Maximum Scores: The minimum and maximum scores provide insights into the range of Y.BOCS.Score within each group. In this case, it is observed that the minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 40 for all education levels within each Score_Type. This indicates that the full range of scores is observed across all education levels, and there are no outliers beyond this range.

# Overall, while there are slight variations in mean and median scores across education levels within each Score_Type, the differences are relatively small. Additionally, the variability in Y.BOCS.Score does not appear to vary significantly across education levels. Further statistical analysis, such as ANOVA, could be conducted to formally assess whether there are statistically significant differences in Y.BOCS.Score across education levels within each Score_Type.

TukeyHSD(obsessions_anova)
TukeyHSD(compulsions_anova)

# Obsession
# The p-value associated with the F value is 0.348, which is above the conventional significance level of 0.05. This indicates that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there are no statistically significant differences in Y.BOCS.Score across education levels within Obsessions. No significant differences are observed in Tukey test.

# Compulsion
# The p-value associated with the F value is 0.169, which is above the conventional significance level of 0.05. This indicates that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there are no statistically significant differences in Y.BOCS.Score across education levels within Compulsions. No significant differences are observed in Tukey test.

# In both cases, since the p-values are greater than 0.05, fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests that there are no statistically significant differences in Y.BOCS.Score across education levels within Obsessions or Compulsions.

# **Introduction**



<!-- Ordered list -->
I will analyze these three research questions below.  
1. Is there a significant difference in the prevalence of OCD among individuals with varying levels of education?  
2. Does the family history of OCD contribute to the development of the OCD disorder?  
3. Are patients previously diagnosed with other disorders more likely to develop OCD?

<!-- Unordered list -->
I will analyze from three aspects.  
* Association of education level with prevalence of OCD.  
* Association of family history of OCD with prevalence of OCD.  
* Association of previously diagnosed disorders with prevalence of OCD.
